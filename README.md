# PlugPoint 🔌⚡

## 📌 Project Abstract

**PlugPoint** is a smart web platform that simplifies how electric vehicle (EV) users interact with charging infrastructure. It allows drivers to quickly find and book charging stations while giving operators full control over charger availability and station management.

The system is split into two main components:
- A **RESTful backend API** built with **Spring Boot**, handling business logic, authentication, and data persistence;
- A **React-based frontend**, designed for a smooth and responsive user experience.

Development followed an agile mindset over six weeks, applying **Scrum**, **DevOps pipelines**, and **Software Quality Assurance** practices such as unit testing, integration testing, and static code analysis. Automation tools ensure that code quality and deployment remain consistent throughout.
